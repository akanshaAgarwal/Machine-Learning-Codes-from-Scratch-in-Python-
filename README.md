# Machine-Learning-Codes-from-Scratch-in-Python
This repository contains the code for the famous Machine Learning algorithms without use of imbuilt models. <br>
All code for most of the famous Machine Learning Algorithms are available here . No imbuilt ML models are used for implementation of these algorithms.<br>
The algorithms implemented are as follows : <br>
1) Linear Regression (with detailed explanation of Gradient Descent)<br>
2) Linear Regression (Shorter and more Compact Code)<br>
